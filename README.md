# Find-Your-Mensa
This is the repository for mobile app: Find Your Mensa.

Please write clear commit message (in English) every time when you commit some changes.

Please create a new branch and work on that branch instead of the main branch when you make big changes and are not sure if they will work or they will damage the stability of the whole application.

Always synchronize your branches (with the remote ones) before starting any work on your own.
